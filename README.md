# Small OOps-EmployeePayrollSystem
This is a simple Employee Payroll System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

Key Concepts Used-
Abstraction: Employee is an abstract class representing a generic employee.
Inheritance: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee extend Employee.
Polymorphism: Salary calculation is handled dynamically using overridden methods.
Encapsulation: Employee data is protected using private fields and public accessors.

The reason I used abstract class is to prevent creation of generic Employee objects all over the subclasses.
